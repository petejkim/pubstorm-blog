There’s a lot for web developers to keep in mind when selecting a site hosting provider. Speed to deployment, reliability, security and requirements for other advanced features all weigh on the selection decision. Finding the right one will abstract a lot of the work and worry that comes with publishing and deploying a site.

### Speed to Deployment:

With static hosts, content you produce can be pushed out quickly and efficiently. Static hosts that offer a [Command Line Interface](https://help.pubstorm.com/) (CLI) require fewer resources and are easy to automate via scripting. You should be able to easily and efficiently make updates several times a day.  A hosting provider that offers straightforward publish and rollback functionality gives you the confidence to update frequently and go back to previous deployment versions if needed.

### Scalability:

If your site spikes in popularity, does it take a while for your site host to scale up?  Serving static content with a Content Delivery Network (CDN) not only delivers faster page loads worldwide, but also continues to deliver static content reliably when servers go down.  Having multiple points of presence around the globe ensures your content can still be served up when one goes down. Look for a hosting platform that includes a production-grade CDN for speed and reliability.

### Security:

Protect your site’s content and your site’s visitors. Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) are open source protocols behind the most popular security implementations. Your static site host should offer these features as part of the standard offering. Additionally, not relying on 3rd party plug-ins like WordPress and Joomla to host your site translates to less time monitoring and patching new vulnerabilities.
