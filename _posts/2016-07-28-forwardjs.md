PubStorm is making a trade show debut at ForwardJS Jul 29 in San Francisco. Come join us for demos, free hosting services and a chance to win a drone. ForwardJS is dedicated to web developers who collaborate and use JavaScript and related tools to bring the next web sites and applications to life.

We’re demonstrating how developers can use [Pubstorm](https://www.pubstorm.com) to publish sites straight from the CLI with feature rich benefits like SSL and CDN, for free. We’re showing attendees that it’s possible to develop and deploy a site in less than a minute. You can find us in the exhibit hall, Friday, Jul 29.
