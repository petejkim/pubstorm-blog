In today’s fast paced environment, consumers and B2B customers alike are demanding more and more of companies from which they buy. More information, more visuals, more videos. And they want them updated more quickly and more often.

In this race to keep customers happy, it’s hard enough just to deliver content. You can’t be slowed down by any technical challenges with your hosting platform. Here are some ways hosting your sites on [PubStorm](https://www.pubstorm.com) can knock down some development challenges.

### 1) Fast Content Deployment

With PubStorm, the content you produce is going to be pushed out quickly and efficiently. Our powerful & comprehensive [Command Line Interface](https://help.pubstorm.com/) will bundle and optimize your assets and deploy them to our global CDN in one simple command. And with our straightforward Rollback functionality, you can be confident in the fact that you can always go back to up to 20 previous deployment versions if needed.

### 2) Fast Page Loading

Static sites fundamentally enable fast page load speeds, improved security, and significant cost reductions. Also, PubStorm seamlessly makes your content reach its viewer faster, by optimizing assets and automatically [publishing all sites to a global CDN with a single command](https://blog.pubstorm.com/static-sites/cdn/performance/cdn-benefits/).

### 3) Search Engine Friendly

You don’t want to spend hours on end searching Moz.com for SEO best practices. PubStorm automatically generates a new sitemap for you upon every deployment, so the search engines always have up to date info. Plus, we automatically configure cache headers to ensure new updates get crawled.

### 4) Free SSL Certificates

You’ll need an SSL Certificate to establish a secure encrypted connection and protect sensitive data, such as credit card information. PubStorm makes this process free and easy. A simple script - [storm ssl letsencrypt](https://help.pubstorm.com/command-reference/storm-ssl-letsencrypt/) – sets up HTTPS on your domain with a free SSL certificate from [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

### 5) No Upsells

You may currently use another hosting provider that tends to act like a nagging parent trying to stop you from doing what you want to do. You want to code and deploy, while it wants you to stop and buy something instead. With PubStorm, you aren’t going to constantly have that annoying parent knocking at your door, sending you email or calling you all the time.

If you are having any technical challenges with your hosting platform, see for yourself why web developers are moving their sites to PubStorm.
