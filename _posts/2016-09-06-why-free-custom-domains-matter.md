How many websites do you think exist today? As we reach the 25th anniversary of the first web page, the internet has surpassed [1 billion](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tomas-laurinavicius/reasons-why-you-should-bu_b_11814388.html) custom domains. That’s a lot of custom domains already claimed by someone else.

With just about every regular word combination claimed by now, you may wonder if it even makes any sense to have your own custom domain. Here are some reasons why custom domains are more important than ever.

### Improve Your Brand 

When you’re getting started, you’ll rely on two types of traffic to your site: organic search and direct. Organic search drives visitors to your site through unpaid search engine results and direct traffic are those visitors who enter your URL into their browsers. In the beginning, your organic search results may be too low to drive much traffic, so it’s vital that people who know your brand name land on the right spot. A custom domain - that is a URL that you define yourself- is going to improve name recognition and increase credibility, which in turn will help you get found online via direct search more easily. Being able to match a domain address with a brand name across all of your customer touchpoints, from website to social media channels and beyond, will increase the chance that someone will remember you.

### Establish Credibility

It’s hard to trust a company with yourname@gmail.com as their primary form of business communication. When interacting with companies and brands, are you going to open an email from a generic gmail, yahoo or hotmail address that you don’t recognize? Without a custom domain, you can’t get a credible email address such as yourname@yoursite.com.

### Improved Online Marketing

Coupled with the right keywords on your website, a strong custom domain can help drive organic traffic over time. For example, if you are a local business, putting your city in the domain can be useful. Often people will search for something such as “Seattle Web Developer” so they can find a local vendor. If your url custom domain includes your city or area, it can improve the chances of people finding you who are searching for your city name and what you offer. In addition, you can organize your company’s emails more efficiently by setting multiple email addresses such as support@yoursite.com, PR@yoursite.com or sales@yoursite.com.

### Improved Flexibility

A custom domain name allows you to take your name with you if you transfer Web hosts. If you are relying on a non-custom domain on a host, you’ll have to completely change URLs if you try to change hosts. A change to your domain is bad news in that you’ll then need to set up redirects to the new site to avoid error messages, and potentially cause a lot of confusion for both SEO and customers searching for your site.

### Why pay more for what you already own?

Many web hosts charge an extra fee to serve your custom domain. As the custom domain is your property and you already paid the registrar for the privilege, why pay more? Look for hosting services that will serve your custom domain at no additional charge.
