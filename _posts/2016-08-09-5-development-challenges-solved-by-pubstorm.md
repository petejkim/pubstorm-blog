Don’t let your site development and deployment be slowed down by your hosting platform. Here are some ways hosting your sites on a reliable static server can knock down some major development challenges.

### 1) Fast Content Deployment

As a busy web developer who wants to be highly productive, you need to push out content as quickly as possible, ideally from the Command Line Interface (CLI), without all of the tedious mucking about with pointing and clicking through a web UI.  A good hosting provider will provide a simple CLI that bundles assets, then deploys them to a global CDN via one simple command.  For those “oopsie” moments of deployment when you’ve pressed “enter” maybe a little too quickly, you should also seek a static site hosting solution that lets you do unlimited rollbacks in seconds too.

### 2) Fast Page Loading

Many websites suffer from slow loading times, and it’s common knowledge that Google and other sites would surface more quickly loading sites over slower sites. Slow load times always threaten to degrade SEO result quality; and from a user experience perspective, users ditch sites in as little as 2 seconds if the page doesn’t load quickly. You need a site host that can almost instantaneously deliver what your users need, and a CDN is a reliable framework from which to deliver what’s needed. In addition, the best site hosting services optimize assets for the fastest desktop, tablet and mobile delivery, so that no matter what your users have, they’ll always find what they’re looking for.

### 3) Search Engine Friendly

You don’t want to spend hours on end searching Moz.com for SEO best practices. In addition to quickly serving sites, a great static hosting service will  automatically generate a new sitemap upon every deployment, so search engines always have the most updated info. Bonus points for a site hosting service that automatically configures cache headers to always ensure new updates get crawled.

### 4) Free SSL Certificates

One concern for web development is how to quickly establish SSL cert for your sites. SSL Certificates establish secure encrypted connections and protect sensitive data, such as credit card information or personally identifiable information (PII). A simple way to implement SSL certs can be established via a quick CLI- for example [storm ssl letsencrypt](https://help.pubstorm.com/command-reference/storm-ssl-letsencrypt/) – sets up HTTPS on targeted domains with a free SSL certificate from [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

### 5) Upselling & Customer Service

The worst hosting services won’t leave you alone to deploy sites, and will continually spam you to add additional services or attach unnecessary bells and whistles to your builds. These same companies may then disappear when you need them the most- if the site is down, or if you just have migration or development questions.  When seeking a hosting provider for your static site- whether to transfer your domain over, or to get started with development- bear in mind the both reliability and responsiveness of your provider.
