One great benefit of hosting your site on [PubStorm](https://www.pubstorm.com) is the access you get to our Production Grade CDN. We provide a lighting fast CDN for your assets, automatic HTML/CSS/JS optimization and support for **custom domains for free**.

Now maybe you’re the type that’s skeptical of anything that is “free.” Here are some questions you might have.

### What are the main benefits of using the PubStorm CDN?

1. Instant access: You don’t have to do anything. Just by setting up your [PubStorm account](https://help.pubstorm.com/getting-started/getting-started/), you’ll have access to our CDN. No additional configuration required.
2. Performance: Using a CDN will help you deliver pages faster. Compare page load times being hosted on PubStorm to those if you were being hosted on Wordpress or GoDaddy. You’ll see a marked improvement, which leads to more visitors.
3. Price: CDN’s can be expensive. PubStorm’s is free.

### If it’s a free CDN, it is easy to set up, or am I going to be spending all day configuring it?

One of the biggest benefits of PubStorm’s CDN is that you don’t need to set anything up. You don't even need to do anything to use our CDN features, as every new project deployed on PubStorm is served up via our lightning fast CDN out of the box. So in essence, simply by deploying your site to PubStorm, you get all the benefits of a CDN as well.

### If it’s a free CDN, it is going to be fast?

We use Amazon Web Services to host PubStorm, leveraging four 4 global “points-of-presence” that constitute our CDN and serve the assets. These are located in North America, Europe, Southeast Asia, and Northeast Asia. By serving your website from multiple points-of-presence around the globe, your pages will load faster than ever. Faster websites mean happier customers who stick around longer.

#### Cache Invalidation

Each time you publish your project on PubStorm, we will invalidate the cache on any updated assets to ensure that we are serving the latest changes, while still preserving optimization on older assets that haven’t changed.  

### If it’s a free CDN, is it scalable? Or will I max out at a certain level?
Our global CDN and infrastructure will ensure we can handle any amount of traffic without skipping a beat. So if your website gets unexpectedly popular on reddit, buzzfeed, or gets picked up by a major news network, you can rest assured that PubStorm will handle the load without breaking a sweat.

### Is it really a free CDN, or is there some kind of upsell?
Yep, it’s really 100% free.
