The static site hosting landscape is shifting. Devs want simple and fast hosting services that are quick to deploy. We surveyed front end developers to get their opinion on [PubStorm](https://www.pubstorm.com) and static site hosting in general. We learned three things:

1. Keep it simple. Developers don’t want to jump through hoops at sign up. They want a free, simple process to get their site up and running in less than a minute.
2. Developers want comprehensive services. They are most excited about having a pre-configured CDN, free SSL cert provisioning, and easy-to-configure custom domain names.
3. Command line interface rules. Developers would rather live inside the CLI than a contrived web interface.

Developers are adding [50,000 sites per day](http://www.internetlivestats.com/) across the web. To continue the pace and meet the performance needs of mobile users, developers are looking for easier, comprehensive static site tools that outperform alternatives, preferably with a command line interface.

Developer feedback on PubStorm demonstrates demand for easy, full featured static site hosting.
